# permutation-and-pointers
## This code demonstrates how we can print the permutations of a certain set of numbers which can be used for various puposes.
### This code also can be used to teach the use of pointers and dynamically allocated array.

# Description:
1. Open the code and type the desired set of numbers you want the permutations of in the 41 line.
2. Save the code.
3. Run the code.

##### That's it!! This code can be changed to learn modularity. I have that repository. If you have any question or suggestion or anything you want to say, you can email. My email is "ehsanzaman.k@gmail.com"
